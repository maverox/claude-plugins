# Code Quality Review Skill

## Overview

This skill performs comprehensive code quality reviews on changes, applying project-specific standards, security best practices, and industry conventions. It identifies issues categorized by severity (Critical, Warning, Suggestion) and provides actionable feedback with code examples.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill **auto-activates** when users request:
- "Review this code"
- "Check code quality"
- "Find security issues in this PR"
- "Validate best practices"
- "Review my changes"
- "Check for code smells"
- "Analyze code for bugs"

The skill can also be invoked as part of `/pr-review` workflow to review all changes in a pull request.

## Input Context

The skill expects one of the following:

1. **PR Number** (reviews all changes in PR):
   ```
   User: "Review code in PR #238"
   → Reviews all changed files
   ```

2. **Specific Files** (targeted review):
   ```
   User: "Review backend/connectors/stripe.rs"
   → Reviews only specified file
   ```

3. **Diff Content** (inline review):
   ```
   User: "Review this code: [paste diff]"
   → Reviews provided diff
   ```

4. **PR Analysis Output** (from pr-analysis skill):
   ```
   User: pr-analysis skill completed
   → Uses file list and scope from pr-analysis
   ```

## Process

### Step 1: Scope Identification

Determine what needs to be reviewed:

**From PR**:
- Get file list from PR diff
- Prioritize by file type (connectors > core > tests)
- Identify review focus areas

**From File Paths**:
- Read file content directly
- Apply relevant quality standards

**From Diff**:
- Extract changed lines only
- Review additions/modifications

---

### Step 1.5: Extract Line Numbers from NEW File

**CRITICAL**: Always extract line numbers from the **NEW file version** (PR HEAD commit) for GitHub API compatibility.

**Why This Matters**:
- GitHub API requires line numbers from the NEW file (after PR changes)
- Diff output line numbers are positional and don't match actual file lines
- Example: Line 22 in diff output might be line 5 in the actual file

**Process**:

#### A. Get PR HEAD Commit SHA

```bash
# Get the HEAD commit SHA of the PR branch
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view {pr-number} --repo {owner}/{repo} --json headRefOid -q '.headRefOid')

echo "PR HEAD commit: $HEAD_SHA"
```

#### B. Fetch File Content at HEAD Commit

For each file being reviewed:

```bash
# Fetch file content at the specific commit
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{file-path}?ref=$HEAD_SHA \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d > /tmp/file_at_head.rs
```

**Important**: This gives you the file as it exists AFTER all PR changes, which is what GitHub API expects.

#### C. Find Line Numbers in NEW File

When identifying an issue, extract the line number from the NEW file:

```bash
# Find the exact line number using grep
LINE_NUM=$(grep -n "{pattern}" /tmp/file_at_head.rs | head -1 | cut -d: -f1)

# Extract the code at that line
CODE=$(sed -n "${LINE_NUM}p" /tmp/file_at_head.rs)
```

#### D. Validate Line Number

```bash
# Ensure line number is valid
FILE_LENGTH=$(wc -l < /tmp/file_at_head.rs)

if (( LINE_NUM > 0 && LINE_NUM <= FILE_LENGTH )); then
  echo "✅ Line $LINE_NUM is valid"
else
  echo "❌ Line $LINE_NUM is invalid (file has $FILE_LENGTH lines)"
  # Skip this issue
fi
```

**Reference**: See `.claude/skills/code-quality-review/references/line-number-extraction.md` for detailed extraction methods and edge cases.

**Key Rules**:
1. ✅ Always use NEW file (PR HEAD commit)
2. ✅ Include `line_reference: "NEW_FILE"` in output
3. ✅ Include `commit_sha` for validation
4. ❌ Never use diff positions (line numbers from diff output)
5. ❌ Never use local file line numbers (might differ from PR HEAD)

---

### Step 2: Apply Quality Standards

Review against project-specific standards:

#### **Connector Integration Standards**

For files in `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/`:

**Critical Checks** (Auto-fail):
1. ✅ Uses `RouterDataV2` (NOT `RouterData`)
2. ✅ Uses `ConnectorIntegrationV2` (NOT `ConnectorIntegration`)
3. ✅ Amount fields use `MinorUnit` (NOT `i64`, `f64`, `String`)
4. ✅ No hardcoded reference IDs
5. ✅ No mutation of reference IDs
6. ✅ No unsafe code blocks
7. ✅ Proper error handling (no `unwrap()`, `expect()`)
8. ✅ Authentication from `auth_type` field

**Warning Checks**:
1. Status mapping correctness
   - Unknown statuses → `Pending`
   - Refund statuses → `Charged` when appropriate
2. Enum usage for limited value sets (not strings)
3. Required field validation at correct layer
4. Proper macro usage (`create_all_prerequisites!`, `macro_connector_implementation!`)

**Suggestion Checks**:
1. Code duplication
2. Naming conventions
3. Documentation completeness
4. Test coverage

#### **Core Domain Standards**

For files in `backend/domain_types/`:

**Critical Checks**:
1. Type safety (no `Any`, minimal `Dynamic`)
2. Proper serialization/deserialization
3. Validation logic placement
4. No business logic in domain types

**Warning Checks**:
1. Missing field documentation
2. Overly complex types
3. Inconsistent naming

#### **Security Standards** (All Files)

**Critical Checks**:
1. ❌ No SQL injection vulnerabilities
2. ❌ No command injection
3. ❌ No XSS vulnerabilities
4. ❌ No hardcoded secrets/credentials
5. ❌ No unsafe deserialization
6. ❌ Proper input validation

**Warning Checks**:
1. Sensitive data logging
2. Error message information disclosure
3. Missing rate limiting (where applicable)

### Step 3: Code Analysis

**Static Analysis**:
```bash
# Run cargo clippy for Rust code
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Check formatting
cargo fmt --check

# Run tests
cargo test --package <relevant-package>
```

**Pattern Matching**:
- Grep for anti-patterns (e.g., `unwrap()`, `expect()`, `TODO`, `FIXME`)
- Check for hardcoded values
- Identify duplicated code blocks

**Type Checking**:
- Verify correct type usage (especially `MinorUnit`, `RouterDataV2`)
- Check trait implementations
- Validate generic constraints

### Step 4: Categorize Issues

Group findings by severity:

**Critical Issues** (Score: -20 points each):
- Security vulnerabilities
- Type safety violations
- Hardcoded/mutated reference IDs
- Unsafe code
- Missing error handling

**Warnings** (Score: -5 points each):
- Incorrect status mapping
- Missing required fields validation
- Improper enum usage
- Code duplication
- Linter warnings

**Suggestions** (Score: -1 point each):
- Naming improvements
- Documentation additions
- Minor refactoring opportunities
- Code organization

### Step 5: Generate Quality Score

```
Score = 100 - (Critical × 20) - (Warnings × 5) - (Suggestions × 1)
```

**Score Interpretation**:
- **95-100**: Excellent ✨ - Auto-approve
- **90-94**: Good ✅ - Approve
- **80-89**: Fair ⚠️ - Request changes
- **60-79**: Poor ❌ - Block merge
- **0-59**: Critical 🚨 - Block merge

```
🚨 Code Quality Review: Poor (Score: 55/100)

**Files Reviewed**: 3
**Score**: 55/100

**Issue Summary**:
- Critical: 2 ❌
- Warnings: 3 ⚠️

---

**CRITICAL ISSUES** (Must Fix):

1. **Type Safety Violation**
   File: `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/newpay.rs`
   Line: 25

   Issue: Using deprecated RouterData instead of RouterDataV2

   Current:
   ```rust
   use hyperswitch_domain_models::RouterData;
   ```

   Fix:
   ```rust
   use domain_types::router_data_v2::RouterDataV2;
   ```

   Impact: Breaks UCS architecture compatibility

2. **Security Risk**
   File: `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/newpay/transformers.rs`
   Line: 67

   Issue: Hardcoded reference ID

   Current:
   ```rust
   reference_id: "TEST123".to_string()
   ```

   Fix:
   ```rust
   reference_id: router_data.connector_request_reference_id.clone()
   ```

   Impact: Payment tracking failure in production

---

**Recommendation**: Fix critical issues before re-review.
```

### Example 3: Targeted File Review

**Input**: "Check security in backend/api/src/auth.rs"

**Output**:
```
🔒 Security Review: auth.rs

**Score**: 90/100 (Good ✅)

**Security Checks**:
✅ No SQL injection vulnerabilities
✅ No command injection
✅ No XSS vulnerabilities
✅ No hardcoded credentials
✅ Proper input validation

**Warnings** (1):

1. **Information Disclosure**
   Line: 145

   Issue: Error message may expose sensitive information

   Current:
   ```rust
   Err(format!("Authentication failed for user {}", user_id))
   ```

   Fix:
   ```rust
   Err("Authentication failed".to_string())  // Don't leak user_id
   ```

**Recommendation**: Address warning to improve security posture.
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Large Files**: For files >2000 lines, focus on changed regions only
- **Clippy Runs**: Cache clippy results for unchanged files
- **Pattern Matching**: Use efficient grep patterns with context limits
- **Parallel Review**: Review independent files in parallel
